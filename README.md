# avocado
__simple blog system built with Django__

# wat do?
Well, edit the __avocado/templates/*__ if you don't want to use the default theme.
Open __avocado/settings.py__ and edit:
- _SECRET_KEY_ to something random
- _BLOG_TITLE_ to whatever you want to call your blog
- _BLOG_DESC_ to whatever you want to describe your blog with
- _COPYRIGHT_ to the current year and your name or keep it blank to remove it


Once you're done with the tasks above you're going to want to go read how to put a Django project in production. Personally I just throw it in a screen session and forget about it - there's some other ways, but that's the quickest I've found. :)


# features
- Markdown support
- Simple design system (everything is in their own html templates for ease of editing)
- Built in Python and with Django
- Lightweight
- Not in PHP
- Not a team of 100,000 devs so the code is rather clean and simple


# contrib
Well, sure - see [TODO.md](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/TODO.md) to see current tasks. I don't think it's necessary for me to make guidelines since it's a small app. Just if you contribute make sure it's ok code and not pure shit - like code you wrote when you first started programming. ;)
